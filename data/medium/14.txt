One evening, a wedding party was held in a beautiful, nice and high-class resturant . A homeless named Paul walked by and was curious to what was happening inside. He was starving, and was looking for a place to take a rest. The music was turned on so loud, and the food were smelling so good. Paul walked in without thinking.

It was a place full of happiness, grace and the most important thing, food. Paul couldn´t stop himself from putting the food in his mouth though his mouth was already full of food. While he was eating, he saw a bottle of wine.

"1989´s Wiskey…" he said with a voice seemed to be desired of alcohol. Paul was once a man that was usually drunk every moment. That´s the reason why he was a homeless. He spent all his money on it. He started to drink, one by one, the bottle were enough to full a pakage!

The man came out and saw him with anger.

"What the hell do you thing you´re doing here?!" the man cried out. He quickly threw Paul out and trying to fix the mass Paul made.

Paul was already drunk. He didn´t know what was he doing, and even where he was.

A police car came by and saw him. Paul thought it was a taxi and trying to stop it. The car stopped and Paul past out very soon on the car. Ten minutes later, Paul woke up with a started. He was in the police station.

These kind of story have happened very often in these day. People who don´t work or have no work are all marking around on the street. This really caused a great society problem. These things should be avoid in our life because we have a group of police who should be working for the people. Having these kind of questions can dissepear soon.
