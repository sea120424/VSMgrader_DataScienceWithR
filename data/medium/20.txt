I am in the junior year of computer science department. I have carefully read the information on the websites and, meanwhile, collected relative reference to have an advanced understanding to this project. The context of the plan make me excited, hence my eagerness of extra connection, hoping to attend this project.
I struggle on my class performance of both computer science and electronic engineering in my previous college years (approaching with enclosed transcript) to build a strong base of various subjects. This built-up knowledge in several topic enable me to observe a problem with diverse perspectives. 
As Neil Alden Armstrong (1969) says, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." A negligible undergraduates as me can have a chance to make contribution to the discovery of the universe. I can propose a software simulating implementation by taking the hardware limitation into consideration to assist the real-world measurement on universal traveling or future work. Rather than the dream proposal or so far unachievable design, I would provide the amalgam of both hardware and software feasibility. 
Despite my superficial understanding on study contrary to the postdoc, I can still help the project by my view on it. Thanks you for spending time reading my requirement. If my ambition and ability is qualified to this plan, reply me via e-mail.
