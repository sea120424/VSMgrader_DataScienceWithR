Many people like to read books because we can learn a lot of information from it. However, sometimes it´s not enough. For example, when the author described how spectacular the view is, we can´t feel how it is, since we fail to experience it personally. At this moment, all we have to do is go traveling. Only traveling can solve our confusion and satisfy our curious heart. When we go traveling, we can extend our sight, know things that we never know and even learn some lesson from it.

I remember that one time I took a trip to mainland china with my family. We paid a visit to WestLake. The scenery I saw really breathtaking. I liked the lake when I was a child. But I didn´t know how big it was! I was so excited that I ran aroud the lake. The astonishing view was not a book could give me. Suddenly, I saw a person throw a gabage to the lake. How could he do that! It actually broke the impression I used have on the Chinese people. Maybe it was a lesson for me.
