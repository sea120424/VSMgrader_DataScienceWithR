One evening, there was a wedding party at a fancy hotel. The party´s atmosphere was so happy and all people including the guests and the new couples cheered to each other all night. Later, the party was over and every person was much drank.

The night became darker and darker and there was few cars on the streets. One of the guests was about to go home by taxi, but he was so much drunk that he couldn´t even distinguish the taxi between the police car. He hired the police car and took on. The police asked where he lived patiently, but he just kept smiled without saying any words…

The next morning, the man finally awoke, finding himself sitting in the police office. He was shocked. When the police told him the whole thing, he felt so embarrassed.
