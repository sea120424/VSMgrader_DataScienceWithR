One evening, my brother dressed himself up in order to attend his friend´s weding. When he arrived at the resturant, he came across a classmate who hadn´t connected with him since he graduated from college. My brother was so happy that he drank a large amount of wine.

After the weding, My brother walked along the street and he wanted to take a taxi. Because my brother war drunk, no driver wanted to let him get on the car. Finally, my brother glazed at a car so he raised his hand and got on it. He fell asleep as soon as he sat. When he wake up, he found he was in police station. How terrible he is!
