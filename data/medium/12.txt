One evening, I went to one of my friends´ weeding in my black suit. I was happy that he married a nice girl. And I was so excited that I drank too much. On my way home, my head was dazzling and my feet were heavy that I couldn´t walk well. So I gave up walking home, waving my hand to stop a taxi. Though I thought that taxi was strange with the sparking light, I still got into the car and told the driver my address. Then I fell into a deep dream in the taxi. The next morning I woke up, I felt uncomfortable and tried to move my limbs to make myself awake. When I stood up, I found that I was in the police station instead of my bedroom. What happened last night? A policeman pointed at the police car outside and told me "That was the "taxi" you took last night, do you have any problem now?"
