Travel is the best teacher, there are three reasons why I consider it. First, we can see anything what we have never seen by traveling around the world. Second, we can realize how different the culture is between us. Last but not least, we can learn a lot of knowledge by ourselies which it have never appeared from the book.

For example, I have gone to the U.S six years ago. I have seen a lot of insterting things in the U.S. The culture is very different from us. The travel not only make me grow a great deal of knowledge but also let me had a good time there. Because of the travel, I can really see anything what I have never read from the book. In my opinion, I think travel is the best teacher of me.
