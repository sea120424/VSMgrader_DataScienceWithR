It was a cozy Sunday afternoon, the sun lazily radiating its warmth to the
residents of planet earth. Prompted by the good weather, I decided to take a walk out
in the park with my girlfriend Amy.
Thinking back on how Amy and I began to date, we were both extremely
addicted to use cell phones. There are times that I wonder if we’d have dated
otherwise. In cell phones games, we enjoyed challenging each other. I once half-
heartedly joked that if I beat her this time she would have to go out with me, and
surprisingly, when I did, she timidly said okay. As things turned out, we were a pair
that would find no shame in admitting being “heavy smartphone users.”
Unsurprisingly, Amy whipped out her phone and began playing as soon as we
started walking. I took out my headphones and pumped up the volume for a few killer
rock songs of the 90s. Immersed in the world of sexy guitar riffs and awesome drum
solos, I slowly began to lose sight of my surroundings…
I was rudely awakened from my trance by a traffic police, who was pinching
me. I couldn’t hear what he was saying because of the music volume, but when I
looked around, I was in the middle of a bustling street, running the red light! I was so
afraid and ashamed I fled from the scene, and that’s when I noticed, Amy wasn’t
beside me. I turned to the park and there she was, lying on the ground, unconscious.
As it turned out, she was too focused in playing that she wasn’t watching where she
was going and crashed into a tree. Me? I didn’t even notice, and continued wandering
in my sidewalk!
“Amy, I think we should really cut down on the cell phones. I know you love it,
but it’s affecting our daily lives. Come to think of it, you’re dating me because I’m
good at gaming right? But I think I love you, gaming or not. So could you do it for
me?” Timidly again, she nodded. We buried our phones in the park and continued our
walk, this time, hands held tight.
