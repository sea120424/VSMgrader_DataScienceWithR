With the concept of equality between genders being widely-accepted, doing
housework is no longer women’s responsibility. Therefore, everyone in the family
should be responsible for parts of houseworks. In my opinion, houseworks discussed
below could be divided into two categories by means of whether it is “professional”
or not. For example, cooking and driving are obviously two of those “professional”
works that require exceptional skills and can only be done by family members that are
capable of providing the skill. While the rest of the family members would be left to
the houseworks that can be done by everybody. Furthermore, parents should also
consider whether the work is too hard for young children to complete. Thus, the
distribution of houseworks should take members’ abilities and ages into
consideration.
In my family, my mom is the one that cooks and my dad is the one that drives.
My brother and I are assigned to maintain our own bedrooms and bathrooms, and we
also do the dishes by turns. In short, my parents are the ones that do the |professional”
works while my brother and I do mostly the rest. I am the kind that really hate to do
houseworks, but while I’m doing it, I find interest in it most of the time. Take
cleaning up my room for instance, I clean up my room about once a month. I’ll first
put all my books back to the shelves and clothes shattering on the floor back to my
closets, then I’ll start sweeping and mopping the floor. As I put the stuff back to
where they belong and see my room gradually turn bright and clean. A sense of
satisfacation fill up my heart. Thus, even though I complain about doing houseworks
everytime before I do it, I actually kind of enjoy the magical process witnessing the
house become clean. In conclusion, doing houseworks might sounds irritated, but
you’ll definitely find some fun doing it!
