Taiwan is an island full of surprises. From marvelous natural scenery to the charming diverse cultures to the warm-hearted residents. These elements I make up the brightest stars in the constellation of the infinite cosmos. Among all, I feel very proud of our country's natural beauty and the cultures. Tiny as the island may be, it is home to a variety of vegetation and animals. Besides, with mountains up to the altitute of 3000 meters, emerald plains scattered on the West wast, and glittering oceans surrounding the island, it offers a gateaway car for us to toss behind the city's hustle and bustle. In addition, the fertile aboriginal culture, Chinese culture and Japanese culture make Taiwan the fertile land to cultivate all kinds of ethnic groups, enabling it to stand out from all the countries around the globe. 
To pave the way for Taiwan to be more recognized internationally, here are two ways I consider essential. Initially, due to the access of the Internet, Taiwan's government should upload videos or advertisement to widely used social platforms or Youtube in order to shed light on our country's beauty. For example, the snow-capped Mt. Jade, the train ride in the forest of 
A-li mountain or the canoe ride beneath the canopy of leaves in Tainan can all be included in the video clip. Secondly, Taiwan can collaborate with Singers or music group to promote our impressive cultures via their music videos or their concerts. For instance, in the video, which is the promotion of the album of the British music group, Clean Bendit is shot in Taiwan. In which, it presents Taiwan's temples and the traditional dances to the audience. It is no exaggeration to say that with these methods, I believe that the vibrant I shades of Taiwan will be spread to every corner of the world.
