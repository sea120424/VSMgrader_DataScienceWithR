Choosing from the two books, I would like to go for Austin Young’s
“LEADERSHIP IS A CHOICE: Conquer Your Fears &amp; You Can Be a Leader Too.”
From its book title, I can tell that this book probably deals with effective ways to help
a timid person to transform into an outstanding leader. The author may have also
lacked confidence in the past, so he wrote the book to share his experience of how he
changed himself, conquered his fears of speaking to the public to talking on a leader’s
responsibilities, and finally became a successful leader. His intention was to tell those
who are lacking in confidence that believing in themselves is not that difficult and
everyone can eventually make it if they follow the tips provided in the book.
As a person who seldom takes part in extracurricular activities, I am not good at
socializing with others and leading a group is often the last things I would like to do.
When interacting with others, I am also worried whether I have uttered something
appropriate that may upset them. Because of my poor socializing skills, I always
avoid being a leader of one group lest I ruin the friendly atmosphere due to my
improper act. All I want to do is to stay in my comfort zone and finish the work I am
assigned to. However, I know well that it is impossible for me to be like this in the
future. Once I enter the work market after my college graduation, I will be forced to
face the challenges from other competitors. Without the ability to lead a group well, I
will not stand a chance of prevailing other people. Therefore, I would like to opt for
Austin Young’s book to help myself surmount my fear of socializing and develop the
capability of being a successful leader. Through following the author’s instructions, I
hope that I can be more at ease when interacting with people and no longer run away
from the responsibility that a leader shoulders.
