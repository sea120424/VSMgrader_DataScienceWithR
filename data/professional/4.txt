One evening, a man named Kris attended a wedding party. It was held in a luxury hotel, where there were a lot of guests.

Everyone talked lively and happily during the meal, including Kris. Being the best friend of the couple, Kris drank a lots in ecstasy because he felt really happy for them.

Later, Kris excused himself and left the party. He stood on the road, waiting for a taxi. But, unfortunately, he drank too much to stay conscious. Upon seeing a car coming to him, Kris waved his arms immediately, saying "Hey, Taxi!" loudly. Then the car stopped. However, Kris wasn´t aware that was a police car, not a taxi!

Kris couldn´t remember anything that had happened during the drive to the police office.He was waken up by a thunderous sound, "What are you doing? Do you know where it is?" said the police officer. Kris was shocked to death but had no reason for explaination.

About 30 minutes later, Kris was allowed to leave. He was ashamed for his "trip to the police office." He appologized to the police officer for his irrational behavior, and promised that he wouldn´t do it again.
