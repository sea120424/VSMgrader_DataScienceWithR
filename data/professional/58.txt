I am proud of the food culture and majestic sceneries here in Taiwan Taiwan is home to many cultures, which in turn constitutes an amazing and complex flavor profile of 
food. Before any foreign colonization or settlement, there were the aboriginal people. They have their own distinct food culture vastly different from the Spanish and Holland people who settled in the late 1500s. Adding to those flavors, settlers from mainland China brought cuisines of their hometown to Taiwan. In recent years, many Southeast Asians have brought their signature sour and spicy tastes to Taiwan. It is clear that Taiwan is home to many different food cultures, which gives lit a very unique place in the history of food. The scenery in Taiwan is just as complex and beautiful. situated in a subtropical climate, it is humid and sticky at low elevations, but cool and even cold in the mountains. Tourists will find a variety of landscapes like canyons and gorges, rivers and waterfalls, as well as dunes and forests on Formosa. The Portugese are certainly not mistaken to call this place a beautiful island! 
Taiwan is definitely a hidden gem in Asia. Not many westerners know about Taiwan, but those who have visited praise it for its landscape, food, and friendliness. Perhaps we can market ourselves to the world to boost the tourism industry. The internet and social media are the best places to start because many people use it on a daily basis. By posting photographs and videos it will allow the world to see Taiwan and perhaps ignite their desire to come and visit. Inviting internet influencers to visit is also a fantastic method. Famous influencers can have up to millions of fans and followers, so it such a person comes, many more will be interested. No matter what approach we take, I am certain that word I will spread itself to the world about this marvelous island.
