I would pick “Everyone is Beautiful: Respect Others &amp; Be Yourself” as my
summer reading assignment. According to the name of the book, I assume it’s about
confidence and learning to accept others as they are. One would face problems in any
relationship when he or she didn’t have self-esteem. Self-esteem, though as simple as
it sounds, might be the toughest thing to grow in a person’s head. Yet when you lack
of this element, you lost the respect toward yourself, and sometimes, toward others.
Becoming cynical and lonesome on the edge of society is the last thing anyone wants,
but no worries! The book just might show us ways to stop the blizzard and help us to
love ourself the way we are, as well as other people.
As a kid, I was over-weight and shy. Being funny-looking to other kids wasn’t
funny at all. I was bullied at school and was never the first pick to be on anyone’s
team. I was the left-out. Gradually, though I refused to believe, the world seemed cold
and ignorant. I was petrified of showing up at school just to be teased around by the
kids with pretty faces. The situation lasted for years, I never made any friend due to
the fact that I judged people as hard as I judged myself, due to the lack of self-esteem.
Not until senior high school did I slim down and finally return to the bright side of the
world. I learned how important it is to love yourself to be able to love others, despite a
part of me still strives to believe this value. I hope to figure it all out while reading
this book. I hope it brings me peace and remedy to my once-broken soul. “Everyone
is beautiful,” I guess we’ll all read it to believe it!
