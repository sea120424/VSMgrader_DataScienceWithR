When people enjoy the convenience brought by innovative technology, the safety
should be considered. Ted, a senior high school student, was on his way to attend the
commencement with his classmate, Kate. It was a scorching summer day. The sun
shone brightly and the wind was whispering. They both looked forward to the event
because they truly expected next four years in college.
When the two delightful students reached the street nearby the school, Ted used
his smartphone to listen to his favorite Rock and Roll music, and Kate also chatted
with friends by hers. However, they didn’t notice the trouble was going to happen.
Just about to check her messages, the careless girl bumped into a tree on sideways,
and she was injured. The pitiful girl yelled at Ted for help but in vain. He was totally
absorbed in the music. What’s worse, he blocked the road when waiting to get across
the street, and the traffic was in a catastrophic mess. Car drivers were in rage because
it was rush hour, the time they went to work. Fortunately, a policeman passed by and
soon took the chaos under his control. “Hey, kid. That would cause a lot of problems,
don’t you know?” This kind man also called the school to take care of Kate. The two
young people really regretted what they had done. Had it not been for smartphones,
they could have had a wonderful ceremony at that day.
