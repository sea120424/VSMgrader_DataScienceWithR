I am deeply convinced that it is every family member’s duty to maintain our
home’s living environment. Since nuclear families have become the mainstream in
Taiwan’s society in recent decades, people need to shoulder more responsibilities to
maintain a warm and lovely family. In the past, people tended to believe it was
women’s duty to keep the house clean and do all the housechores. In addition, if
wives didn’t make their husbands feel comfortable at home, they were usually the
ones to blame by either family members or society. However, things have changes.
With more and more women going to work these days, I think they are not the only
ones to do the housechores anymore. Every family member should be treated equally,
which means to share both happiness and duties with each other. Husbands can start
with washing clothes, and children can help to take out the trash. It will be more
efficient for all the members to clean up the house. Thus, I believe we can spend more
time having animated conversations with our family, and enjoy their company.
Take my family, for example. My parents are both bread-winners. Nevertheless,
after a long and tiring day at work, they never complain about the chores they have to
complete. My father cooks three meals for us, while my mother washes the clothes
and takes out the trash. Also, my brother and I are not couch potatoes. We help to do
the dishes and sweep the floor. I really enjoy the time my family and I doing
household chores together. What’s more, I find how wonderful it is to coordinate with
my brother. We not only finish the job in twenty minutes but also keep up with our
school lives when we are sweeping the floor. I think I grew up in an incredible
security blanket because my family and I know that it is everyone’s duty to maintain
the environment in our home so that we can live in harmony forever.
