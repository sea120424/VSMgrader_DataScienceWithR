Taiwan has been selected as the best country to live in the world due to our great security, beautiful landscape, kind people, and soon. The two things which I'm pride to be a Taiwanese are kind people and the health care system, Taiwan is famous for enthusiastic people. Wether you are foreigners or people who is not familiar with this land, Taiwanese people will assit you proactively without a hesitation, Although some local's English are not good, they will do their utmost to use poor English or body language to communicate with foreigners, Their kind is the most beautiful thing in Taiwan. The other thing I take pride in is our health care system. We can go to see a doctor with little money. This system 
benefit our life tremendously especially for those who doesn't have enough money to see a doctor Many people from other countries are longing to have a health care system because going to see a doctor will cost them a fortune. However, some developed countries want to carry out the system, but they end up failing because of the lack of finance. By contrast, Tainan success and become prosperous. That's why I'm proud of having a health care system,
Although Taiwan is home to a lot of treasure, less people know about us. We can use social media such as Youtube or Facebook to welcome Internet celebrities to introduce Taiwan. After watching their films or reading their posts, they might find Taiwan interesting and want to travel here in person. In addition, everyone is a diplomat in Taiwan. Helping foreigners or haring foreign friends online give us the opportunities to share about the beauty of Taiwan. We can share about our cultures, foods, and features to them; thus, motivate them to know more about Taiwan. To sum up, everyone can make friends or use social media to promote Taiwan, With little effort |made by every Taiwanese, we can make the world see our magnificient island
