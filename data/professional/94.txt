If I were to select a book for summer break, I would choose “Leadership is a
Choice” , by Austin Young. I believe, from the front cover, that the book is set out to
foster and cultivate the next generation of leaders. And from the indications
mentioned, I would think that the book will start out with listing possible hampers one
is likely to encounter during his or her journey to become a leader. Following with
suggesting ways to nullify those fears and presenting methods to overcome the
obstructs faced. The book is also likely to act as a step by step handbook to becoming
a leader by showing requirements and steps to become one. Perhaps it also includes
examples of prominent and renown leaders with their life stories. All in all, the
content seems intriguing to me.
Reasons of my chosing “Leadership is a Choice” can be divided into two. First
of all, my personality and character traits. I always had the urge to handle or
breakdown an incident first hand, and my courageous, bold, but pliable nature can be
suitable in either accomplishing knotty decision making moments or alleviating
damage done. I consider a position of leader somewhat challenging, but I am also
eager to engage in a more intensive learning of it, by consulting to the book of course.
Secondly, I believe my previous experiences enable me to better relate to the topic, for
the fact that I took part in various leadership camps and conventions, inclusive of one
visiting Israel. With my processed knowledge, contents about leadership will less
likely to complicate and obfuscate me. Furthermore, the experience and proficiency I
hold will only contribute to accelerating the learning process and guide me through
the book more swiftly. Despite my strengths, I still am aware of my debility such as
being clumsy and too tentative. Recognizing the book as a supplement towards my
complete personality and a tool to achieve success, I would like to read “Leadership is
a Choice” with all my heart.
