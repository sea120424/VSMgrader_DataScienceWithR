Among the books which are recommended by school, I would like to read
Leadership Is A Choice which is written by Austin Young. The book may contain
three parts. First of all, for individual, it will teach me how to cultivate the ability of
dealing with crises. While leading a group, it is very likely to face some urgent
situations. How to stay calm and solve the worsening situation is a significant lesson
which should be learned by all leaders. Second, for groups, the book will teach me
how to communicate and interact with others properly. In the modern society,
cooperation plays an important role in all groups on the ground that two heads are
better than one. As a result, how to compile all information and opinions from
teammates and make an appropriate decision appears so important to a good leader.
Third, the book should also contain how to encourage others and cheer my group up.
After all, the efficiency of a group can’t be overemphasized, and the key to leading an
efficient group lies in convincing and inspiring words.
If my memory serves me right, this incident took place when I was choosed as a
club leader one year ago, and it etched in my mind. When I had to declared some
information on the stage, I found that I had a stage fright. When I assigned jobs to my
teammates, they didn’t pay attention to what I had said. When I tried to share my
viewpoints with them, it would eventually give rise to an endless argument. Not
surprisingly, the club which I led didn’t have a good performance in the end of the
semester, and this drove me sorrowful. It seemed that I fell into a bottomless abyss of
despair. Even though the incident came to an end, the memory will still linger on.
Based on this reason, I make up my mind to become a true leader. How to conquer my
fears and those challenges is the first thing I need to do. As a result, I will choose
Leadership Is A Choice, hoping to find a correct avenue to cultivate leadership and
become a successful leader.
