I would choose Everyone is Beautiful: Respect Others and Be Yourself. It should
be a book about mutual respect between people and being proud of who you are. Just
as a classic cartoon theme song sings. “You think the only people who are people, are
the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger,
then you’ll find things you never knew.” Indeed, living in the era of globalization,
everyone should learn the fact that everyone is beautiful and show respect to others.
This book might teach us to break down the stereotypes in our mind, and appreciate
the great variety of beauty in the world. On the other hand, being ourselves is also
important. The book might as well teach us to admire the beauty within ourselves. As
long as we learn our advantages and drawbacks, we can face the world with an open
heart.
As one of the citizens in the globe, I should learn to respect people from different
countries, and even people of different religions. Nowadays, traveling abroad is much
easier than in ancient times. We have many chances to interact with people from all
over the world. Showing respect is a great way to live in harmony with others. At the
same time, being myself will let others know who I am, where I’m from, and what
Taiwanese culture is like. Recently, the incident that ISIS members executing
foreigners cruely has horrified the world. If everyone had learned to respect others,
the tragedy might not have happened. I must have the ability to respect others as I step
into the society of multiculture, and that is why I pick this book.
