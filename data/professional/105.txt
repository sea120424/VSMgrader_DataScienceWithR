Some people think that it is the parents that need to take full responsibility for
house cleaning, and all the children have to do is to pay attention on their academic
performances. While others consider house chores the whole family’s obligation that
no one should be left behind. As far as I am concerned, every member in the family
should do their parts to maintain the environment of their house. For kids, it is of great
importance that they learn to do chores when they are little. It teaches them to become
more responsible in a group and indeed help them to be more independent after
moving out in the future. For husband and wife, equality on every aspect stabilize
their marriage. Doing the same proportion of home chorses is definitely crucial when
two people desides to live together for the rest of their lives.
When I was younger, I started to assist my mom in doing the dishes and I took
out the garbage as well. As time went by, I am now in charge of recycling all the
bottles, paper and so on. Moreover, I clean the bathroom once in a while, since my
parents are unable to bend down for a long while anymore. As annoying as house
chores sometimes may be, I still do my best to clean the house. Every time when I
think of my mom’s backache and my dad’s hurt knees, I cannot help but to di as much
as possible to relieve their stress and pain. As long as I can help my parents,
unpleasant chores can turn into delightful jobs.
