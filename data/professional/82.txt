Books have always been my best company during summer breaks. This summer,
I would like to read “Everyone Is Beautiful” by Caroline Strong. According to its
cover, I believe the book is focusing on two different aspects, respecting others and
being oneself. The first part, respecting others, talks about the open-minded attitude
towards other people. When we encounter different personalities, habits, or opinions,
how should we react? This is a major question for the book to answer regarding the
first aspect. The second part of the book teaches us how to love ourselves, embracing
the advantages and shortages in us. Ways to avoid negative emotions such as jealousy
and despair are the selling-points of this book.
My attraction to this book is based on two reasons. First, I believe mutual respect
is the basestone of a peaceful and harmonic society. Recent events such as the Charlie
Shooting in Paris and the protests in the USA both originated from to disrespect of
other cultures. The tragedy of Charlie was a brutal retaliation from the long-
discriminated Islamic people in France. Although the disrespecting cartoons didn’t
justify the shooters’ actions, it questions the balance between freedom of speech and
respect. Therefore, it is essential for world citizens to learn how to respect others in
order to live as a family. The second reason I choose this book is because I want to
learn how to fully embrace myself. There are always times when I feel depressed and
wish I was born differently. However, I can’t change what is already gifted to me
whether I like it or not. Judging by its title, I believe this book is exactly what I need.
Only when I can freely be myself will I live a happy life. These are my two reasons
for favoring this book. I can’t wait to embark on my journey of reading.
