When you saw the romantic EiffelTower in the movies, or watched the Great Wall of China on TV, have you ever imagined that you could admire such specific constructions on the sense some day? The advantages of traveling is a lot. First, traveling can make us open our eyes, we can see the senery not through the media, but by ourselves. How wonderful that you can appreciate breathtaking senses just in front of them! Second, with the advanced education, we have known a wide variety of knowledges about many countries. Such as history, climate and even customs, but if we never been the places, it is no use to get so many informations.

During the winter vacation this year, I took a trip to Sigapore with my family. This was my first time to go abroad. In those four days, I learned a lot about this lively country, including saw the famous Merlion, visited the Indian temple ... etc. When the guide gave some informations for us at some spots, I could merge them in to the geography class easily, even could answer the questions from the guide. I was proud of that I could use the knowledge in books to the real life!

However, there is a great deal of advantages about traveling, so I sincerely recommend that you should take a travel someday!
