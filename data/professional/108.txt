I believe that chores should be shared by each member of the household. It’s
simply unfair to expect a single person to take care of everything from taking out the
trash to mopping the floor. These tasks are usually dull and time-consuming, and
they’re capable of driving one crazy if one needs to spend an unreasonable amount of
time on them. In addition, I think that each family member has the obligation to pitch
in to help around the house. Chores need to be done to ensure a properly-functioning
household, from which everyone in the family can benefit from and appreciate.
Therefore it’s only natural for each individual to share a piece of the burden of doing
chores; after all, it’s the atmosphere of your own family you’re working hard to
maintain! My ideal household, consequently, would have a system that includes each
family member in the management of chores.
My household operates under an autonomous chore-doing system. Nobody is
assigned to one particular job. Instead, each family member volunteers to take on a
job when something requires being done. For example, my mother might volunteer to
do the laundry, but the task of hanging the laundry to dry will fall to either myself, or
my brother. The same “rule” can be applied to taking out the trash, or mopping the
floor. The burden of doing chores never falls upon one single person, and I really
appreciate this system. When I do chores, if feels less of a burden and more of a
voluntary action to help maintain the environment of the house. When I’m washing
the dishes, for instance, I don’t whine or complain about it because I know I’ll be
living in a much more comfortable environment once the stack of dirty dishes has
disappeared. Overall, my belief is that everyone should take part in doing chores.
Sure, scrubbing the toilet or emptying trash cans may seem like nasty, undesirable
jobs, but if we view our labor as something that can benefit our households, doing
chores can turn into a pleasant task.
