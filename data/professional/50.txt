On a scorching summer day, Mom and Dad intended to take me to a well-
known amusement park as a reward for my straight A’s score on the final exam.
Exhilarated and delighted, I jumped into my dad’s car, singing cheerful songs. The
blazing sunshine came streaming from the outside as intermittent breeze gently
kissed my cheek. Dad told a plethora of jokes all the way, which made Mom and me
giggling from time to time. Everything was pleasant and beautiful. However, God
played a tremendous prank on us. As luck would have it, when our car travelled onto
the highway, it was utterly strapped by a host of vehicles. At first, we could kill the
time by chatting. Nonetheless, after a while, the sentiment was severely sabotaged.
We all went impatient. I kept murmuring and moaning on the situation. Mom and
Dad struck up a conversation about the inefficiency and drawback of the
transportation system. Beads of sweat covered everyone’s forehead. I even thought I
was on the point of getting heatstroke.
But the worst did not reveal itself until we arrived at the amusement park.
Getting out of the car, what came into my view was the entrance of the park being
packed to the brim with hundreds of tourists. Wallowing in frustration, I began to
regret embarking on the trip. It almost took us an hour to bought the ticket as well
as set foot in the sought-after amusement park. Much to my astonishment, when I
walked through the entrance, all of the staff clapped their hands and cheered.
Unable to realize what had transpired, an enormous gift was sent to my hands.
“Congratulations!” said the staff. We were later informed of the fact that we were
the 2000 th guest at that day. With joy running through my veins, I clench my fists,
punching the air in delight and hugged my parents. As we won the prize, it was free
for us to enter the amusement park at any time!
