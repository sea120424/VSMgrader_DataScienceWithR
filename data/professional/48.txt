On the first day of winter vacation, the Lin family decided to visit Taipei Zoo. They put their
laugage into the car and set off in the early morning. Mr. Lin was so happy that he kept singing
when driving. However, when they drove on the high way, they found that they were stuck in the
traffic jam!
After two hours of waiting, the Lin family finally arrived at the zoo. What they had seen was
that there were hundreds of people waiting for entering the zoo. Mr. Lin wanted to find another
tourist spot, but his daughter, Cindy, insisted that she wanted to see the pandas. In order to fulfill his
lovely daughter’s hope, they waited in line for another two hours. They began to be tired and
wanted to give up. Cindy even fell asleep on Mr. Lin’s shoulder.
Finally, it was their turn to enter the zoo. Much to their surprise, two people in Panda costumes
ran to them. “Hello! Congratulations! You are the number 1000 who enter our zoo today!” said one
of the Pandas. Another man in suit said continuously, “Therefore, you can visit our zoo for free! I
am the manager here, have a nice time!” The Lin family felt so surprised and thought that the long
and boring waiting paid off. They laughed delightfully while seeing the Pandas eat bamboos. “We
are really lucky, aren’t we?”, said Mrs. Lin with a big smile on his face.
