There used to be an ancient saying in China that men should be driven from the
kitchen. However, with the publicity of the gender equality concept, I think the saying
is totally obsolete. In my opinion, the distribution of housework should be fair. For
instance, some private chores such as washing one’s own dishes and cleaning one’s
own room should be done by ourselves. Since the house is shared by the whole
family, we should at least do our own parts of work instead of pushing all the
responsibilities to our poor mother. As for chores like sweeping the floor, washing the
car and setting the dining table should be assigned fairly, too. We can take turns doing
them whenever we have free time. In my point of view, doing house chores is all the
family members’ duty rather than our mother’s. If all of us can share the house chores
together, we can definitely maintain our living environment efficiently.
As for the condition in our family, it’s definitely a great model. Even though my
dad has to work, he still helps to do some housework on holidays, especially tasks that
takes strength. My brother and I are busy with schoolwork every day, but we still do
our part pretty well. Furthermore, during winter and summer vacation, we even help
to clean our house. To me, it’s a great experience to grow mature and independent.
Doing house chores not only teaches me the ability to take care of my own life but
also strengthens the bond with my family. It really gives me a sense of
accomplishment and belonging. It makes me feel that I’m a part of the family. I
believe I’ll keep this great habit and make our home a better place.
