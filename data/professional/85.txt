Of these two books, I prefer “Everyone is Beautiful: Respect Others &amp; Be
Yourself” written by Caroline Strong. Judging from the book title, it crosses my mind
that its content might center on how we teenagers should build confidence, whether
on the appearance or inside. I assume the author to be a psychologist, and thus she is
making her utmost efforts to encourage those who don’t feel pretty about themselves
and to teach those who taunt others for their faces or shapes to respect others. In
addition, I guess that the author will add some real-life cases on the ground that the
readers will better reflect to themselves, also adding stronger supports to her ideas.
The main reason for my choice is that I am not quite confident about my looks
and I am constantly disturbed by the unfair judgements by others. Therefore, I would
like to pick a book that could ease my stress and cheer me up. Other reasons about my
decision are that I’ve read articles about leadership and that I don’t fear to stand up
and be the head of a team. Above are the reasons why I decide to make Caroline’s
book on my summer vacation reading list.
