Sarah and her twin brother, Stephen, were walking home together. Stephen was
walking around with a bounce in his step, dancing along to whichever song that
played on his MP3. Meanwhile, his sister walked along in an absent-mind state. Her
shoulders were hunched over as her eyes were glued to her smartphone screen.
Fingers nimbly flashed across the screen as Sarah concentrated heavily on her game,
with the full intent of beating her previous high score.
Unbeknownst to Sarah, a tall tree loomed ahead of her path. However, since she
was so focused on her phone, Sarah didn’t spare the time to look up and check where
she was going. Within a few step, Sarah found herself walking headfirst into a tree.
Her forehead took the impact, but the shock was so strong that Sarah dropped her
phone in response to her injury. The phone fell to the pavement with a clatter. A
young mother-daughter pair witnessed the accident, and rushed forward to pick up the
fallen smartphone and hand it to Sarah.
In the meantime, Stephen walked an ahead without missing a beat. He was
utterly oblivious to his sister’s accident. The sound in his headphone had been
cranked up to a deafening level. He wanted it at the loudest possible configuration so
that he could enjoy the bass reverberate inside his head. The insanely fast tempo of
the music made his blood ran wild. Stephen’s attention was absorbed into his dance
routine; to the extent that he didn’t notice the car that was driving right at him, nor did
he heard the car horn’s urgent warnings. Luckily for Stephen, Sarah had seen him
dance right into oncoming traffic. She quickly ran over to grab her brother by the neck
of his uniform and dragged him over to the sidewalk before he became road kill.
Sarah gave her brother a stern lecture about the importance of being aware of where
you are walking, and privately vowed to herself to follow her own advice.
