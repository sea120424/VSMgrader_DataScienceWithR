Chinese tradition demands that women be servile to their husbands and be solely
responsible for the attendance to household environment. However, people nowadays
have begun to recognize “family” as an integral whole. The pith of such concept lies
in the keywords “sharing and caring.” In my opinion, it’s more important for family
members to acknowledge their moral duties to the family and always remain
supportive, while actually prescribing a list that arranges the allocation of household-
chores duties seem rather otiose. When one family member has work at hand, those in
leisure can perhaps go mop the floor or do the dishes. Such type of collaboration lasts
longer than any sort of regulation since it rises from one’s heart and one’s will.
This is exactly the way my family works. Household chores can be exhausting,
but since both my parents and I understand that it’s a means towards better living
quality, we never grudge to spare out time and labor whenever there are chores to be
done. If the floor seem a little dusty, I’d just go and sweep it; if I spot greasy plates on
the table with leftovers on it, I’d just clean them up. The same goes for my parents. I
have developed the habit of doing household chores since an early age, and though it
sometimes bothers me—especially when I have to force myself out of the sofa in
times of fatigue—I remind myself that this is what pulls a family together. After all, a
clean house always brightens the mood, and as we’re all sheltered under the same
roof, a good mood surely helps us live in harmony and bliss, driving away brawls and
conflicts!
