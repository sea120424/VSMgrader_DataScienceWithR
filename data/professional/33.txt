"Never, never give up" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. I think it's a very good piece of advice for all of us.

　　Never stop working for your goals doesn't mean you must be successful; it doesn't even mean that you must achieve your goal, but it's very important to keep it in your mind.

　　You want to be a great basketball player, but you are 1,60m tall; you want to be a great pianist, but what you have studied in the university was physics; you want to establish your own company, but you are just a clerk in a small company. These examples are very common in our real lives.

　　There are enough unfavorable conditions which make our lives difficult, but what important for us is to make efforts towards your goal or your dream. If you have given your best for your goal or your dream, whether you succeed or not, at least you won't leave any regret in your life. What's more, who knows, what will happen in the next 10 years?

　　You might not be a famous basketball player, but you could become a good player in the basketball-team of your school. You might not be a great pianist, but you play the piano very well and enjoy yourself after the heavy work every day. You might not be able to establish your own company yet, but you are just collecting experience and knowledge as a good manager, and maybe in 10 years, you will become the boss of your own company.

　　Few of us have perfect lives, what I want to say is, don't give up working for your goal or your dream. If you succeed, you will taste great joy in your life. If you don't succeed, you won't have regret in your life because you have given your best. Besides, in trying to achieve your goals, you might find out that perhaps your goals are not correct or not practical at all, then you can improve them and make your life more beautiful.
