EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL: Respect Others &amp; Be Yourself classmates,
written by Caroline Strong, is definitely the book I would love to read, professor
Strong has been doing her utmost to protect human rights as well as teaching the
world how precious it is to be true to oneself. Since 1996, every book she published
has inspired readers worldwide to cherish the uniqueness of every individual. As a
huge fan of hers, I believe this book is not an exception. In fact, from the title
“EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL.” I know this very book not only discusses the
differences between one another, but conveys the idea that beauty is actually defined
by ourselves instead of others. What’s more, she shows “how” to be beautiful,
teaching us to respect others and be yourself. Perhaps she can give me some tips so
that I can cope with my problems in school, or maybe she can grant me her attitude
towards life so that I can learn to define my beauty myself. I firmly believe that
professor Strong will again surprise me with her intelligence and creativity, and teach
me even more about how to be myself in her new book.
This is the book I desire to read because for me, a senior in high school, it is
rather difficult to find a balance between the world and my true self. There are nights
when I wonder aimlessly in town with the wind chilling me to the bone. I feel like a
phantom without a soul. The world seems to have engulf my soul and thus I can no
longer find myself, let alone define my own beauty. Therefore, I believe professor
Strong will once again lift me up from such mental turmoil, and lit up a candle in my
heart. By reading this book, I am sure that I will no longer be lost in my longing to
blend into the complicated world. As professor Strong puts it, “Everyone is
beautiful,” I know she will guide me through my high school life and eventually help
me discover my real inner beauty.
