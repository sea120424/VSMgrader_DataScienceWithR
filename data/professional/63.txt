As the saying goes, " The most beautiful scenery in Taiwan is people. "I consider the two best things I am proud of in Taiwan are the lovely residents in this wonderful island and the spetacular landmark in Taipei - Taipei 101. Indeed, when it comes to Taiwanese, many foreigners will marvel at the hospitality and kindness, of us; however, I think the greatest trait of Taiwanese our optimistic attitude toward difficulties. For example, whenever a typhoon severely hits Taiwan, despite the fact that we have to be faced with the difficult task of cleaning our beloved hometown, we still have the ability to do it... positively instead of keeping complaining our situations. the other thing I quite pride in is the tallest building in Taiwan; nonetheless, its advantages are more than its height. By standing on the observation of Taipei 101, not only can we appreciate the whole scenery of the hustle and bustle in Taipei,' but we can also realize the characteristic of the city. It is actually a lovely place with panssion and energy. 
I have several ideas to introduce these things which have been mentioned above. First and foremost, we can invite people in other countries to visit this energetic island by holding some worldwide activities. By doing so, they will experience the beauty of Tawai in person, and the feeling is quite different from hearing the information from others. V Furthermore, we can make a good use of the Internet and post some interesting things on it. If we have the ability to establish a new website, all of us can be a diplomatic and promote those features we are proud of. Last but not least, we can get acquainted with many friends living in foreign Countries and told them a variety of things about Taiwan. I firmly believe that if we can make an effort to put Tainan on the map, one day in the future, Taiwan can be the most visited island all around the world.
