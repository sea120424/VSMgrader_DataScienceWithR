People face all kinds of difficulties and problems in their daily lives. Most of the time, I prefer to resolve my problems based on my own experience and knowledge instead of consulting others for solutions. There are plenty of reasons behind this; for example, I can always solve problems by myself, and that way I do not bother others, am more efficient and can make better decisions.

Solving problems individually doesn’t bother others. If a person asks me for advice overly frequently, I would feel really annoyed. In addition, some tasks require people to solve problems by themselves instead of asking others for help, such as when students are having an exam at school. Therefore, in order to prepare for those individual tasks, people should try to be independent while solving their daily problems. However, the advantages of settling a matter on one’s own do not end here.

People can solve problems more efficiently if they they can do it on their own. People have to explain the issues that they have faced to every single person that they are trying to get the advice from. That’s time consuming. Also, different advisors might give the asker different advice. Thus, choosing an appropriate suggestion among them all would also be a complicated procedure. However, solving problems by themselves would be a much simpler process.

Last but not least, most of the time, resolving issues individually has the best chance of coming up with an appropriate solution. Every person knows themselves better than anyone else. When someone asks others for advice, advisors usually give their advice based on their personal experiences. Sometimes the advice might not applicable for the advice taker. Thus, it is best to make decisions on one’s own instead of trying to get someone else’s advice.

When we confront a problem, we should try to solve it by ourselves if we can. In this way, we will become independent, use time efficiently and find the best solutions for our issues. As we grow, we face more and more problems. Solving them without the help of others (help from others) is an important life skill we must all master.
