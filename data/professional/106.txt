Most people think women should do all the chores for the family. However, in
my opinion, all family member should take their share in it. Since we live together in
the house, we are in charge of every aspect of it. Chores are the most important things
to make it tidy. If everyone always expects Mom to do the chores, it’s unfair. So it is
necessary for everybody to do a little. People can choose the one that they are good at,
or they can choose what to do based on their ability. Furthermore, if they feel tired
that day, they can decide to do an easy one. Briefly speaking, each person in the
family has to do the chores because everyone has to take care of the living
environment.
Take my family as an example, we have a schedule on the wall. On the schedule,
which kind of chores should everybody do every day are listed. All of us have to obey
it and make every effort to finish them. Thus, we work diligently to maintain our
house clean. Also, we have different jobs each week so that we will know which ones
are harder and will take turns to try some difficult ones. I still remember the first time
I did the dishes. It was in the winter and everything I touched was cold, especially the
freezing water. Throughout the process, I broke several because my hands were
shaking. Frustrated, I kept moving on. After finishing it, I almost cried. I finally
understand why my mother’s hands always bled in winter. After that, I always have
respect for the one who is washing dishes because it feels really bad with the cold
water. In addition, I will never take it for granted due to my experience. I’m grateful
of that. Thanks to it, I learn that nothing is as simple as it looks and I’ll always
appreciate what I have now.
