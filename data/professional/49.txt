It was probably the most unforgettable family trip ever. Last weekend was the
first day of the winter vacation. My dad had promised me to take the whole family to
the amusement park that I had long desired to get up earlier in case the amusement
park would be crowded with people. On the next day, when the sunlight had just
pierced through the sky, coloring everything golden and shiny, I woke up without my
mom’s call. I was so excited that I jumped up and down on my parents’ bed, shouting
all the facilities I could think of, trying to wake them up. We soon got our stuff
packed, while Dad delightfully humming rythms. Everything seemed to be so smooth
and exciting. However, after we drove up to the highway, we were stucked in a
traffic jam. Cars barely moved as if this was not a highway but a parking lot. I began
to feel a bit disappointed, but Dad then came up with an imagination game to kill
time. He told us to imagine how excited and fun we were in the amusement park.
Magically, it worked. Time passed quickly and we eventually got to our destination.
Out of expectation, the amusement park was already full of people. Hundreds of
thousands of tourists were waiting in line. It seemed that when we finally got in, it
would be already at noon. My dad was like a magician, and he could always come up
with amazing ideas to solve the problems. He went to the counter and asked the
worker, ”Can I wear Micky Mouse costume and work here for free a day and let my
family in first?” After hesitated a bit, the worker nodded. My mom and I held hands
with the Mickey Mouse happily and entered the amusement park. I spent an
wonderful day playing there while my dad played his Mickey Mouse role perfectly
and took pictures with tourists around the amusement park. Thanks to my magician-
like dad, I was able to complete our family day so well and feeling content.
