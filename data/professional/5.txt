One evening, John was invited to his old friend´s wedding. Meeting so many classmates in university, he became more and more excited. He talked a lot with other, laughed happily, and also, drank a lot.

When it got darker and darker outside, he knew that he had to go home. So much did he drank that he couldn´t even drive home on his own. He then walked on the side of the road and tried to find a taxi to take him home. He waved to the cars, shouted out something, and even ran onto the road with his body turning round. Not long after he did these, here came a car. It stopped in front of him, and he got on the car without hesitation. And soon, he fell asleep.

When he opened his eyes again, he found himself in the police station. To his dismay, he didn´t remember what he had done yesterday. A policeman came up to him and scolded him angrily. He was too embarrassed to look up at him. He really learned a lesson from the impressing mistake.
