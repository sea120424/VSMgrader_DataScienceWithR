After school, Nick and Norah cheerfully walked down the winding road toward
home. It was finally the last day of school, and both of them couldn’t wait to have fun.
Nick pulled out his walkman and played his favorite rock song while Norah took out
her smartphone and started playing video games. Within a minute, both of them were
immersed in their own colorful world. “Mom! Look at the boy dancing so
awkwardly!” a girl from behind exclaimed, yet her mom only smiled, a little
concerned about what might happen next.
Just then, “Bang!” Norah suddenly bumped her head upon a tree. She felt sharp
pain in her nose as blood slowly came out of her nostrils. The extreme pain sent her
back to reality. Everyone was left speechless by the accident. Everyone except Nick.
He must have been too busy dancing to the beat to notice what just happened right
next to him. “Nick! Be careful!” Norah shouted out in hysteria, warning him of the
danger he’d been putting himself in, yet he was already crossing the busy street while
the traffic light was still red.
“Get off the way!” all the noises of car horns and sounds of rage couldn’t reach
Nick’s ears, for the drums and vocals of the music were too loud and occupying his
mind. Nick danced all the way across the street, leaving numerous drivers fuming
with rage.
When the traffic light finally turned green, Norah quickly rushed toward Nick
and violently took off his headphones. She then explained what happened to her and
the fact that he almost got hit by a car, only because both of them were too careless
about the outside world. A sense of guilt suddenly surfaced in his mind. He felt sorry
for not taking cool care of his little sister and also for the drivers’ inconvenience.
After the incident, both of them finally knew the importance of safety and they never
listen to music or play video games while walking ever again.
