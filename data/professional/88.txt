I’d definitely go with the book Leadership is a Choice: Conquer Your Fear &amp;
You Can Be a Leader Too. My guess is that the book is divided into two sections:
“how to conquer fears” and “examples of leaders.” In the first section, the author
illustrates ways to make one more courageous and display one’s charisma, such as
actively participating in extracurricular activities and ceaselessly expanding one’s
social circle. In section two, the author renders the readers more insights into what it’s
like to be a leader by bringing up some of the greatest entrepreneurs in the industry.
Apple’s founder Steve Jobs, Microsoft’s CEO Bill Gates, Facebook’s creator Mark
Zuckerburg, and Amazon’s chairperson Jeff Bezos are undoubtedly included in this
section.
There are an assorted array of reasons why I chose the book, one of which is that
the leaders I listed above are all idols I’ve been trying to emulate. Thus, to this end
I’ve been serving as a club officer in a volunteer club, scheduling and leading mission
trips for one and a half year. I also took part in several internships, aiming to train
myself to be the one that serves before morphing into the one that leads. With that
said, this book would help me comprehend the word “leadership” better and really get
me acquainted with those prominent leaders of today. To conclude, I’d like to address
that for as long as I can remember, I’ve been craving to become a leader, a navigator
that directs the whole crew of people, and I believe that under the anspices of this
book by Austin Young, I’d eventually fulfill my aspiration someday in the future.
