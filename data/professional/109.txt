I strongly believe that maintaining an enjoyable home environment is the
responsibility of every dweller in the house. As the saying goes, “There is no such
thing as free lunch.” Therefore, while basking in the relaxing atmosphere the house
provides, we should also think of doing something in return. Take house chores, for
example. The messiness of our houses is caused by every member living in it. Thus,
the task of keeping the house clean should also be equally divided. Due to the fact that
home plays an impeccable role in the hearts of every member, every member should
also evenly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining it.
In my home, all the chores are divided evenly. While my father is in charge of
cleaning the floor, my mother does the laundry. Which leaves me the job of doing the
dishes. Unbekonwnst to others, doing the dishes brings me not only joy, but also a
great sense of accomplishment. Seeing the once greasy plates instantly become
smooth and glistening is, in fact, quite tantalizing for me! Many of my classmates
often regard me with an incredulous expression when I tell them that doing chores
brings me great fun. In my opinion, this is because they regard it as a complete waste
of time. Nevertheless, I see it as an act of making our home a cleaner and cozier place.
Doing chores is definitely not meaningless. It builds our personality because it
indicates that we take things seriously and take full responsibility of every task in our
life.
