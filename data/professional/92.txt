Given the choice, I would choose to read Austin Young’s “Leadership is a
Choice.” As we are all well aware of, being the leader of a certain group of people can
be quite challenging. Judging by its cover and subtitle “Conquer you fears and you
can be a leader too”, this book is probably about how we could overcome the various
obstacles on the way to becoming a successful and effective leader. Like most things
in life, the real barrier blocking us lies deep inside our minds, and heading a team is
no exception. We may dread the thought of shouldering all the responsibilities, fear to
demand more of your subordinates, and even run away from the fact that you’ll have
to constantly step onstage to announce and command. Therefore, I believe this book
will go through all the possible ways to remove the barriers of fear in our hearts. It
would probably illustrate the points more clearly by showcasing stories of successful
leaders and how they magneto break through their fears. It would explain to us that
there is a leader inside everyone, and all you have to do to reveal it is to get ahead of
your dreads.
As for the reason why I would choose this book, I believe I still lack some of the
traits to becoming a successful leader. Too often when I am appointed to head a class
project, I would feel the butterflies in my stomach and my legs would tremble
incontrollably, for I take myself incapable of being a nice classmate and a power
leader at the same time. As a result, I sincerely hope that this book could enlighten me
and conquer the worries constantly murmuring in my brain. Only by doing so can I
stand a confident person onstage and smoothly lead my team forward. And as shown
on the cover, a man climbing a ladder upwards, I plan to go through this book and
learn to turn the various fears and obstacles into stepping stones to a better leadership.
