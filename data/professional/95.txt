I believe that everyone in the family, regardless of age and sex, should take up
the responsibility of keeping the environment tidy and comfortable because families
are supposed to support and cooperate with each other. Without help from any of the
members, the person whom the house chores now fall on upon will be tired or feeling
fatigue due to lack of time to rest. To keep in harmony, it is important that everyone
has a portion of house chores to do within their ability.
In my family, everyone does house chores. My mother does most of the dishes
and the laundry; my father vacuums the floor every other day while my brother and I
fold the clothes and maintain the tidiness of living room and bathroom. With the help
from every member, we share a warm and cozy living place which is not only a place
to sleep but also a place we gather to support each other, to learn how we give and
take and be in the same pace with each other. From my experience, I feel grateful that
my family all do their own portion of housework. In this way I feel supported and
viewed as an important individual because I do put effort in making this family happy,
and that, I believe is the most meaningful reason to do house chores.
