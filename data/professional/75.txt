The twins, Jenny and Jared, received brand new iPods as their birthday gifts from
their mom yesterday. Both of them were thrilled and almost couldn’t live without their
fancy presents. Jenny was still fascinated by the multiple functions the iPod had, and
she thus became a “Head-down tribe” since she couldn’t take her eyes off of the
monitor. On the other hand, Jared had already mastered the iPod and indulged in the
tracks he downloaded from iTunes greatly.
Today, the twins walked to school with their iPods. Jenny fixed her eyes on it as
usual, while Jared was happily enjoying the top song at Billboard. Their mother and
young sister followed behind them to keep their company. All of a sudden, Jenny hit a
trunk carelessly. So strong the hit was that she had almost passed out, and her mom
came to her aid immediately, blaming Jenny’s distraction. However, Jared was still
listening to music with his eyes closed and didn’t notice what was going on. He kept
walking as if the whole world was infusible exclusive of him and his iPod.
Jared was still wearing his headphone while crossing a road. The volume he set
was too high for him to hear other sounds, and little did he know that he blocked a
car’s way. At that time, a furious man suddenly appeared in front of Jared and pulled
his headphone off. “Pay attention to traffic safety, dude!” shouted that man as he
pointed behind. Jared was shocked to see that what the man showed him as a heavy
traffic jam! He apologized to the man and walked across the road quickly with flames
of embarrassment burning in his mind.
Before long, Jared saw his family on the sidewalk and surprisingly found Jenny
had a big bruise on her forehead. After a few words of explanation, everyone
understood what happened. Annoyed, mother decided to take the twins’ iPods back
until they learned the importance of safety. Standing at each other, Jared and Jenny
exchanged a knowing look. They would bear today’s lesson in mind forever!
