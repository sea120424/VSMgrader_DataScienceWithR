I will doubtlessly choose “LEADERSHIP Is A CHOICE: Conquer Your Fears &amp;
You Can Be a Leader Too” as my extra reading in summer vacation. The book may
introduce what traits a brilliant leader should have and how to achieve the goal of
being a good leader. Besides, it may also mention the importance of teamwork, since
if there is not a cooperative group, there is not a leader. Moreover, it will tell me how
to conquer my fears, obstacles, and frustration that I will have to face if I make up my
mind to be a great leader. To sum up, the book must be worth reading due to the three
inspiring themes mentioned above.
The reason why I would like to read a book regarding leadership is also the
reason why I expect myself to be a nice leader. I am convinced that a world full of
responsibility and sincerity is undoubtedly better than a world made up of lies and
hatred. The world we live in is not yet perfect, so there must be people who pursue a
better world. However, everyone has his own dream. Therefore, a competent leader
who is courageous, unfrightened, and fair is necessary in order to assemble people to
fight for a common goal. Take Gandhi of India for example. The originally-colonized
Indian inspired by him protested in peace for their liberty, and they succeeded. It’s
why a leader is significant. But nobody is born flawless. Leadership is a choice more
than a gift. The book will tell me how to become a good leader, how to work with
others and how to fulfill my dream of bettering the world. With the help of this book,
I will be doubtlessly on the right way which leads to a promising future.
