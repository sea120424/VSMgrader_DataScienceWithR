I´ve been to many countries before, and I enjoy my trip very much every time. To me, travel is the best teacher. By traveling, I can always broaden my mind and open my eyes to the things about which I had no idea before; I could also see the things which appeared only in the textbook before and that´s no doubt a wonderful experience.

Last summer, I went to Malaysia with a foundation, I used to consider it to be a poor country, but I was totally shocked at how prosperous it is! So many tall buildings and well-organized communities were right before my eyes! We also had some interaction with the local students. I found their learning attitude very active, which was very different from that of the Taiwanese students.

After my trip to Malaysia, I realized that many countries in Asia are prospering, while Taiwan seems to be going backward. I also remind myself that we should never look down on others, and we should equip ourselves with knowledge and unique perspectives, so that we may be able to be outstanding rather than being overwhelmed by the others. We should be more active in our learning and try to set up our goals.

If I hadn´t been to Malaysia, I wouldn´t have gained so many insights in these things. To me, travel is truly the best teacher.
