When I was very small, my parents told me to refuse the things that strangers gave me. I keep their words in my heart, so when I meet strangers, I always keep distance. Every time when I see the news about how kids are get kidnapped, I know I have to learn to protect myself. Sometimes it is necessary to say no to others.
