Everybody will have the unhappy moment. It is important for them to deal with the negative emotion. When I am unhappy, I will listen to the songs that I like, and then dance in the room. Or sometimes I will ask my friends to go to the cinema, watching comedy helps me forget about the sorrow. I find my ways to deal with the bad mood.
