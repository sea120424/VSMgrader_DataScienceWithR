Last night, my friends and I made the plan to go out for fun. But early in the morning, I was too tired and couldnâ€™t wake up. So I lied to my friends. I toldl them I was not feeling well, so they came to see me. I felt so bad to break my words. I decided to be honest to them. Since then, I will always keep my words.
