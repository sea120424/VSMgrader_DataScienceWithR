There is a fair in my hometown every year. It is to show their farm work for the local people. Every year, the fair catches many people to visit this place. I love the fair so much. There are so many people, and I enjoy the lively atmosphere. I can also enjoy the food and music at the same time. I am so looking forward to the new fair.
