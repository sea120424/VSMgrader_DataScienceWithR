We have many travel expiences in our life, like graduate travel, camp on the mountain, visit museams….etc.Every travel have little or much knowledge in it.Even you think that you just play in traveling, in fact, you learn more about life which you can´t learn in common life.I have ever gone to Japan once time.I learned many things in the travel.That was my first time to take the plane.I learned what I can do and what I can´t do on the plane.When we got Japan, I found first thing which is different from Taiwan is that their cars and people drive or walk on left.It shocked me because I think that worldwilde.
