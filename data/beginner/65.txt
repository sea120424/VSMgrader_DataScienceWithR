Today, my mother has something to do, so she needs to meet her friends. I make a promise that I will clean the house when she returns. But I become lazy soon. I start to play computer games and forget my promise. When I remember, I start my work quickly. I feel so bad to almost let my mother down. Luckily, I finish my job and my mother feels happy.
