When I go to primary school, I have to learn a lot of classic poems, which are written by famous old poets. Though it is hard for me to recite, I still finish the tasks. These classic poems canâ€™t be ignored and it is important to cultivate my interest in our culture. Chinese culture has so many things for me to learn and I love it.
