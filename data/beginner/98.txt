Today, when I go home after school, I find that I lose my key. I feel so worried and try to remember all the places I have been to. As I walk into the shop, an old man stops me and asks if I lose the key. I feel so excited and say yes. At last, I find my key and go home. Though I am lucky this time, I tell myself not to do it again.
