I like eating meat so much and I am so picky about food. My parents always worry about my diet, and they try to let me eat vegetables and fruits. But I only can have a little. But after my mom learns to make food with all kinds of cartoon pictures, I start to have a lot of food and donâ€™t picky anymore.
