Two years ago, I lived in my hometown. It is a beautiful place for me and I like the life there. Every day, I wake up early in the morning, then I will walk in the country road with my grandma. We will meet some people and we say hello to each other. The trees are so green and the water is so clean. I play a lot of time in the small river. I have the beautiful memory there.
