I like to watch movies, especially when I see the inspiring stories, I will feel touched. These stories are good for me. They inspire me to move on when I meet difficulties. The heroes will never give up, and finally, they succeed. So if we want to realize our dreams, we also need to be persistent. Some day, we can make it.
