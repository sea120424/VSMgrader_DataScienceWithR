My friends and I have planned to do something interesting. We write down our future wishes and put them in a bottle. Then we exchange the bottles, making it as our secrets. We make a deal to take it out five years later and see if we have realize our dreams. No one knows what will happen tomorrow, but we are so looking forward to the moment when we open the bottles.
