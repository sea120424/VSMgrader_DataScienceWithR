Chinese food is famous all around the world. A lot of foreigners speak highly of the delicious food when they come to this big country. For me, I like spicy food, so hot pot is my favorite. I can eat what I like and put the food in the spicy soup. The hotness makes me feel so cool. No matter where I go, Chinese food is always my favorite.
