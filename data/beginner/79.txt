As a child, I like to eat all kinds of meat, but I donâ€™t like vegetables. My mother always tries to let me eat some vegetables. She educates me that balanced diet can help me stay healthy. I start to realize the importance of balanced diet, so I try to have vegetable. Later, I find that I fall in love with it, and now vegetable is necessary food for me.
