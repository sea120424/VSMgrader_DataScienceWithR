My uncle invites our family to visit him at this weekend. I am so excited, because we will spend the time in the lake house. I will play with my cousins so happily. We havenâ€™t seen each other for a while. My uncle and my parents will share the daily things, enjoying the leisure time. This weekend will be the precious memory in my heart.
