Since the new neighbors move next to my house, every morning, I can hear someone singing, and the voice is so nice. So I decide to say hello. Then I see a girl who is almost my age standing in the garden, and she is practicing her voice everyday. She is very happy to see me and say hello to me. Since then, we become good friends.
