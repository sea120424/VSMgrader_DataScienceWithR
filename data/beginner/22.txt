Two days ago, the weather forecast predicted that the cold wind would blow and today, early in the morning, I felt the chillness. The weather changes so quickly that it is very cold in the afternoon. I started to feel sleepy in the class, but I tell myself to keep focus. Winter is not the excuse to loosen attention.
