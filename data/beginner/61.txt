When I was very small, I saw an interesting movie, which was called Kongfu Panda. The fat panda image was so lovely and I learned that there was such a lovely animal in the world. Since then, I fell in love with this animal. I learn a lot of relevant knowledge. Panda is dying out, so we need to protect them by protecting the environment.
