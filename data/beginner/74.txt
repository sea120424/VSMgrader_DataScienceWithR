I live in an ordinary family. Though my parents are not rich enough to buy what I want, they give me the best thing. That is love. I have a rich friend. Her name is Lucy. She always complains that her parents are too busy and donâ€™t have much time to play with her. So I am so thankful for the things I have. I feel the real happiness.
