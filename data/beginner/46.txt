When I go to school, I find my classmates are talking about something, so I ask my friend when they are talking. He tells me that there is a rumor about our headmaster. Everybody is gossiping about it. I am very curious and talk to a lot of friends. In the end, the rumor is turned to be wrong. I feel so sorry to spread the news. I learn the lesson that I should respect others.
