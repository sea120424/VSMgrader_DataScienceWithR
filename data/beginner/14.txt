Two days ago, when I was shopping with my friends, we saw a foreigner having some problems with the shop assistant. They couldnâ€™t communicate well, because the assistant did not understand English well. I wished I could help the foreigner to solve the problem, but my English was not good enough. So I must study hard to master the international language well.
