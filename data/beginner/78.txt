Two years ago, I read the fairy tale of Cinderella. Everybody knows Cinderella is treated badly by her stepmother and she is finally rescued by a prince. It seems such a wonderful story for girls, but now I realize that Cinderella is negative to life, because she just waits for someone’s help. She should fight for herself. We can’t only expect other people’s rescue.
