I get used to finishing my task in the last minute and my excuse is always tomorrow. I think time is enough for me and I want to play computer games first. As a result, I feel so hard to finish the task. So I want to make some changes. I must finish the task first and then to do other funny things. Never wait for tomorrow or I canâ€™t finish my job.
