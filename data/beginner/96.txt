Today, I go to my friend’s home, because she asks me to play with her. As her mother has something emergent to do, so she asks us to look after her little boy. At first, we think it is an easy thing, but later, the boy never stops playing, and goes up and down. We can’t stop him. What a naughty boy. I realize my mother’s effort to raise me.
