I have a sister. She is younger than me. My sister has a special talent. She sings very well. Every time when she starts to sing, people will be quiet and listen to her singing. Sometimes I feel jealous, but I have to admit that her voice is so nice. I am so proud of being her sister, because we share the same families.
