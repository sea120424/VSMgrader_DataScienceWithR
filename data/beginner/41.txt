Disney movies always catch my attention. Recently, the animation movie Beauty and The Beast will be brought to the screen again, but this time, the real actors play the classic movie. Though I have seen the animation, I am still look forward to the new one. The beautiful heroine Bell is my favorite character. I love her kindness and she is a good girl.
