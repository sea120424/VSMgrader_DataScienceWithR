People always say that the way a person treats the waiter decides what kind of person he is. I agree with it. My parents are polite persons. Since I was very small, they have educated me the manner. Like I shouldnâ€™t talk while eating and talking loudly in public occasion is banned. The good manner helps me to be a better person.
