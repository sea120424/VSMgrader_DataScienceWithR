As summer vacation is coming, my parents have made some plans for me, because they want me to learn something useful. This first thing they want me to do is to learn swimming. This is an important skill. It can save my life if I fall into the water. I also want to learn swimming, so that I can do many cool sports. I am so excited about the lesson.
