Last week, I did not do well in the English exam, and I felt so lost. I talked to my friends, then they inspired me to keep move on and one time failure was not a big deal. I feel much better and face my problem. I tell myself not to lose heart. Now I can smile to trouble. It is important to have positive attitude.
