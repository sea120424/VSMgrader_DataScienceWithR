Every student needs to face all kinds of exams. When score comes out, they just like sitting in the court, waiting for the judge to announce the result. Actually, my mother never cares about my score, she tells me that all I need to do is to improve my ability, and sometimes getting the high score doesnâ€™t mean the ability. I agree with her.
