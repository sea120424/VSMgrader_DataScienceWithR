Everybody has an idol in their heart, who will set the good example for them. In my eyes, a good idol should bring the positive side to the public, so I donâ€™t mind whether they look pretty. My idol is the real hero. He works so hard and never gives up. His persistence helps him to make the great achievement. I should learn from him.
