In Thailand, there are many flooding incidents especially in the rainy season (May to September). As a consequence of the large flood in 2011, many FDI factories started moving their production to other developing nations (Fernquest, 2011). While it is a good idea, SMEs could not just simply do that due to their resource scarcity. To mitigate the risk, the company could elevate the shop floor and build a brick wall surrounded the factory to avoid the flood leaking into the factory.

The Production Director exerted that, “Machine may have a major breakdown during the production disrupting the whole supply chain system”. To mitigate the problem, they would need to outsource the order to other suppliers.

Cyber Security may also cause the disruption of the smart factory system. The IT Director admitted, “There are many security threats that can ruin the supply chain however we are not capable of developing the antivirus software, therefore we will purchase the security suites from the vendors”. He further added, many cyber security problems arise as a result of employees’ faults wrongly opening fishing emails, therefore the company needs to raise employees’ awareness, develop proper training sessions and disseminate security policies to make them available to employees. In addition, the company might employ specialists in cyber security so any security issues would be dealt with instantaneously. Finally, the company’s data should have a backup server to protect company’s vital data in unanticipated situations.
