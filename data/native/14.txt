For the writing class I chose the topic of “Self assessment” because this topic is interesting for me and the audience for many reasons:

First of all because the self-assessment is important to define clearly the progress of personal development ;

The audience is interested in psychology because it is always interesting to get acquainted with one’s self-assessment to be able to avoid pitfalls of self-assessment made by others in the course of their own self-assessment;

process of self-assessment is always a challengeable task, because people always attempt to conduct a self-assessment but they do not always succeed, as it is closely connected with the inadequate self-esteem or self-awareness.

In the whole the writing process involves generating ideas, developing and organizing the ideas, and revising and editing them. Effective writers do all these stages for the best result, so that the writing achieves its purpose.

When writing the essay I had the next goals:

To write well-organized paragraphs for different subject areas, with supporting details;

– to demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic;

to spot main ideas and support details.

Writing an essay is a very private process, as it shows your own writing style, your thoughts and vision of the topic.

It was very important not only to follow the topic, but also to show the right order of thoughts and material so that it flowed from one area, to follow a logical order. Each part of the essay should follow on the previous parts, and the whole body of the essay should clearly come to the conclusion.

I tried in my essay to Essay writing requires to use both creative and critical thinking. Creative thinking encouraged me to broaden my ideas, while critical thinking encouraged me to narrow the focus of my ideas on the main topic of the essay.

All these strategies helped me to organize my essay in the best way, so it would be interesting and understandable for the audience.
